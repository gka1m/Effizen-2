This project is a frontend project in which I wanted to try out web development on my own for the first time, and I utilized the React open-source Javascript library, developed by Facebook (now known as Meta) to create my frontend project using components and Tailwind CSS to make the development of the webpages more seamless.

The project has the features of a conventional productivity/task-tracking frontend project, but I added in another feature inside this project which took me a little longer to completet it: the Pomodoro timer. It is a time management method in which the decided task to be done would be broken into intervals, namely a work phase (typically 25 mins in length) and a rest phase. This method has been shown to promote concentration and minimize mental fatigue.

This project was initially planned to be a fullstack web application that I would host, and I do still want to make it a reality, but for the backend portion of this project, it would require me to learn a lot more concepts as compared to the frontend, and to avoid being overwhelmed, I decided to focus more on the frontend portion of the project first.

Project Features:

- Task management with options to delete and edit tasks
- Pomodoro timer
- Settings to change time of work and rest phases
