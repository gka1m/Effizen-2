### Introduction

This project is a frontend project in which I wanted to try out web development on my own for the first time, and I utilized the React open-source Javascript library, developed by Facebook (now known as Meta) to create my frontend project using components and Tailwind CSS to make the development of the webpages more seamless.

The project has the features of a conventional productivity/task-tracking frontend project, but I added in another feature inside this project which took me a little longer to completet it: the Pomodoro timer. It is a time management method in which the decided task to be done would be broken into intervals, namely a work phase (typically 25 mins in length) and a rest phase. This method has been shown to promote concentration and minimize mental fatigue.

This project was initially planned to be a fullstack web application that I would host, and I do still want to make it a reality, but for the backend portion of this project, it would require me to learn a lot more concepts as compared to the frontend, and to avoid being overwhelmed, I decided to focus more on the frontend portion of the project first.

### Project & File Breakdown

I used React, Typescript and Vite to write the source code that I have submitted in this folder. I used typescript becuase it enforces static typing, which ensures that the code is more readable and reduces the chances of runtime errors. It also makes it easier to scale and maintain the code in the long run.

I used Vite, which is a modern build tool focusing on speed and performance. I chose this as compared to other tools like Webpack as it has features like hot module replacement, allowing developers to see changes instantly on the preview instead of refreshing the whole page, as well as native ES module support. In the context of this project, using Vite offers faster builds and a smoother experience developing this project.

I used Tailwind CSS in the development process, as this would allow me to save time on writing CSS code, when I can use predefined classes in the HTML code itself instead of toggling between the CSS code and the tsx files. I only reverted to writing vanilla CSS code when the effect I wanted to apply was very specific, e.g. a radial background.
